# irisNet

Practicing ML on the Iris dataset. 

## Objective.

The goal is to practice Machine Learning concepts on this small dataset. 
Also gain some coding experience. With as much different tools as possible. 

## How.

First, I will focus on using Keras with Theano on the backend. (Maybe TensorFlow later? To see if it makes any difference...). The dataset will come from sklearn. 

Later, I'll try to do more things by hand. Theano or other framework directly. 
Maybe Python only.

Finally, maybe use other languages altogether. 

## After that?

#### Visualization. 

Visualize the dataset and export the graphs. 
Visualize the training with maybe something like Keras.JS.

#### Optimizing.

Even though the goal is not to beat any benchmark, I'll try to find and document what improve performances. Find the "best" model. 

#### Bigger datasets.

After that, I'll try to graduate to bigger and maybe more interesting flower datasets. 

The Visual Geometry Group provides 2 datasets: the 17 and 102 category dataset. They are composed of images of flower this time.
